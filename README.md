Mathematica code for the mathematical analysis of the mean-field approximation of our
agent-based model in a simple setting. See the paper for more details on the model.

The code is in a Jupyter notebook, as I have been using
[`WolframLanguageForJupyter`](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter)
to develop and run this code. Hence the `environment.yml` file, Python is only used to
launch the Jupyter server, which I connect to a WolframLanguage kernel.
